# Central Documentation of the Library Management System

## Overview
This repository acts as the central documentation point for all architectural and structural aspects of the library management software system. 

The Library Management System v1.0.0 is designed to streamline and simplify the management and administrative processes of libraries. By consolidating all library operations into a single, centralized system, the platform aims to reduce bureaucracy and administrative overhead. One key feature is the introduction of a unified library card system, enabling members to access all libraries managed by this software with just one card, regardless of the location. This approach not only simplifies user access but also significantly reduces operational costs by minimizing the need for redundant systems and processes.

As the system evolves, new features will be iteratively developed and integrated, continually enhancing the efficiency and capabilities of the platform.
