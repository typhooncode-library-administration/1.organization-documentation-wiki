# Central Documentation for Library Software Architecture

## Overview
This repository acts as the central documentation point for all architectural and structural aspects of the library management software system. 

### Datalayer
The datalayer is responsible for managing data storage, retrieval, and database interactions. It includes the database schema, ORM configuration, and data access logic.

### Frontend
The frontend handles the user interface and user experience. It is built using modern web technologies to provide a responsive and intuitive interface for users to interact with the library system.

### Backend
The backend manages the application logic, APIs, and server-side processing. It handles requests from the frontend, performs necessary computations, and interacts with the datalayer to fetch or update data.

## Software Requirements
The key requirements and expectations for the library management software system are documented in the [Software Requirements Document](SOFTWARE_REQUIREMENTS.md).

### Entity-Relationship Model Requirements
The key requirements that describe the relationships and rules in the ERM are documented in the [ERM Requirements Document](ERM_REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Getting Started
To get started with the library software system, please follow the instructions in the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md).
