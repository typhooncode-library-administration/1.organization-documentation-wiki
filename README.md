# Central Documentation for Library Software Architecture

## Overview
This repository acts as the central documentation point for all architectural and structural aspects of the library management software system. 

### Datalayer
The datalayer is responsible for managing data storage, retrieval, and database interactions. It includes the database schema, ORM configuration, and data access logic.

### Frontend
The frontend handles the user interface and user experience. It is built using modern web technologies to provide a responsive and intuitive interface for users to interact with the library system.

### Backend
The backend manages the application logic, APIs, and server-side processing. It handles requests from the frontend, performs necessary computations, and interacts with the datalayer to fetch or update data.
